# RL-Souls
The goal of this project is to use Reinforcement Learning algos to teach an agent how to play Souls games (FromSoftware) like Dark Souls III. 
Different algorithms will be tested and fine tuned to figure out which methods works best.
I am working on this project during my gap year between my M1 and M2 at Sorbonne Universite.
